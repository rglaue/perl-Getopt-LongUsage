Revision history for Perl module Getopt::LongUsage.

0.12	2014-07-07 reg
	- added documentation that describes the format of the output from
          ParseGetoptLongConfig(), taken from Getopt::Long source
        - Throw warning and return undef, if Getopt_Long argument is not
          provided to the GetLongUsage() method.
        - Fix bug in GetLongUsage that gave an internal error on run time when
          an option defined in "descriptions" was not also defined as an option
          in "Getopt_Long". Now carps a message that the option is not defined.

0.11	2013-05-30 reg
